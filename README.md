# common-service-interface-example

Example repository that conforms to the Common Service Interface.

## How To Use

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:ahawker/common-service-interface-example.git
$ cd common-service-interface-example
$ alias cri=make
$ cri
```

**THAT IS IT!!!!**

Do not read the source code. I'd like to see how explorable the interface is w/o understanding the structure.

## What to change/complain about something?

Not right now. I have notes and this is WIP.
